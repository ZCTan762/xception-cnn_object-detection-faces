# An Xceptional way of looking at CNN models

An implementation of the Xception CNN architecture used for object detection within images. To demonstrate this, [a dataset from a Kaggle competition to detect features in faces](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/2020-2021-cnn-contest/data) was used. 

This notebook is used as the accompanying codebase to a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@tanzc762/an-xceptional-way-of-looking-at-cnn-models-359a84879b50), where a more detailed walkthrough can be found.
